# Backend Project – Next Steps & Daily Practice Guide

This README explains **what to do next** after your current Express + MySQL CRUD app. It follows **real backend industry practices**, step by step, with **code examples** and a **daily practice plan**.

Your current stack:

* Node.js
* Express
* MySQL
* dotenv

---

## 1️⃣ Organize Folder Structure (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 🔍 What this task means

Organizing folder structure means **separating responsibilities**. Instead of writing everything in one file, each part of the application gets its own place.

This follows the **Separation of Concerns** principle used in real backend systems.

### 🤔 Why this is important

* Makes code **easy to read and maintain**
* Makes debugging faster
* Allows team collaboration
* Makes testing possible

### 📂 Recommended Structure

```
backend-project/
│── src/
│   ├── config/        # Database & environment configs
│   ├── controllers/   # Business logic (what happens)
│   ├── routes/        # API endpoints (URLs)
│   ├── middlewares/   # Code that runs before controllers
│   ├── utils/         # Helper functions (hashing, etc.)
│   ├── app.js         # Express app setup
│   └── server.js      # App startup
│
│── tests/             # Automated tests
│── .env               # Environment variables
│── Dockerfile         # Docker build instructions
│── README.md
```

### 🎯 Result of this step

Your project becomes **scalable, professional, and production-ready**.

## 2️⃣ Use dotenv Correctly

### 🔍 What this task means

`dotenv` allows you to store **sensitive information** outside your code.

Examples:

* Database credentials
* Secret keys
* Ports

### ❌ What NOT to do

```js
const password = '123456'
```

### ✅ What to do instead

Store secrets in `.env` and read them using `process.env`.

### 📄 `.env`

```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=StudentManagement
JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey
```

### 📄 `db.js`

```js
const mydb = mysql.createConnection({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME
})
```

### 🎯 Result of this step

* Secure application
* Easy environment switching (local, test, production)

---

## 3️⃣ Implement Authentication (Login & Register)

### 🔍 What this task means

Authentication answers the question:

> **"Who is this user?"**

It allows users to:

* Register (sign up)
* Login (sign in)

### 🔐 How it works (simple flow)

1. User sends email + password
2. Password is **hashed**
3. Hash is stored in database
4. On login, password is compared
5. Server generates a JWT token

### 🤔 Why hashing is required

* Protects user passwords
* Even admins can’t see real passwords

### 📄 Password hashing

```js
bcrypt.hashSync(password, 10)
```

### 🎯 Result of this step

* Secure login system
* Foundation for authorization

---

## 4️⃣ Authorization & Route Protection (Middleware)

### 🔍 What this task means

Authorization answers:

> **"Is this user allowed to access this resource?"**

Example:

* Only logged-in users can access `/users`

### 🧠 What middleware does

Middleware runs **before your route logic**.

### 🔐 Auth Middleware Logic

1. Read token from request headers
2. Verify token
3. Allow or deny access

### 📄 Example

```js
app.get('/users', protect, getUsers)
```

### 🎯 Result of this step

* Protected APIs
* Secure data access

---

## 5️⃣ Central Error Handling Middleware

### 🔍 What this task means

Instead of handling errors everywhere, you use **one global error handler**.

### 🤔 Why this matters

* Clean controllers
* Consistent error responses
* Better debugging

### 🎯 Result of this step

* Cleaner code
* Better API responses

---

## 6️⃣ Testing with Mocha & Chai

### 🔍 What this task means

Testing ensures your API works **before and after changes**.

### 🧪 Types of tests

* Endpoint testing
* Status code validation
* Data validation

### 🤔 Why testing is important

* Prevents breaking changes
* Builds confidence
* Required in real jobs

### 🎯 Result of this step

* Reliable backend
* Fewer bugs

---

## 7️⃣ Dockerize the Application

### 🔍 What this task means

Docker packages your app with:

* Node.js
* Dependencies
* Configurations

So it runs **the same everywhere**.

### 🤔 Why Docker is important

* No "works on my machine" issues
* Easy deployment
* Industry standard

### 🎯 Result of this step

* Portable backend

---

## 8️⃣ Deploy on Render

### 🔍 What this task means

Deployment makes your backend **available online**.

### 🚀 What Render does

* Builds Docker image
* Runs your app
* Manages servers

### 🎯 Result of this step

* Live backend API
* Shareable URL

---

## 9️⃣ Daily Practice Plan (IMPORTANT)

### 🗓 Day 1 – Structure

* Refactor folders
* Understand file responsibilities

### 🗓 Day 2 – Environment

* Add dotenv
* Remove hardcoded secrets

### 🗓 Day 3 – Authentication

* Register & login logic
* Hash passwords

### 🗓 Day 4 – Authorization

* JWT middleware
* Protect routes

### 🗓 Day 5 – Testing

* Write Mocha/Chai tests
* Break code intentionally and test

### 🗓 Day 6 – Docker

* Create Dockerfile
* Run app in container

### 🗓 Day 7 – Deployment

* Deploy on Render
* Test live endpoints

### 🎓 Final Learning Outcome

You will understand **HOW and WHY** real backend systems are built.
